## Abstract
The purpose of our research project was to use machine and deep learning algorithms to analyze live data to develop an effective and practical method of instantly detecting an oncoming seizure in patients with chronic seizure disorders including petit and grand mal epilepsy. A seizure involves excessive nerve and neuron signalling that creates an overload of electrochemical activity in the brain resulting in involuntary, autonomic sensations, behaviors, and even physical movements ranging from momentary or complete cessation of breathing and consciousness to dramatic to uncontrolled intellectual and/or physical activity that endanger patients and those around them. Some epilepsy and seizure disorders can be effectively treated; others even cured; however, due to the damage each and every seizure can cause to the brain, preventative care must start as soon as possible. One method of detecting oncoming seizures involves monitoring and recording electromagnetic wave activity in the brain through an electroencephalogram (EEG).  EEG waves. Electric signals are sent through various nodes of the brain that control different parts of the human body, and the data received is the activity of the brain. This recorded activity through these waves can provide huge insight into detecting seizures in the brain. Through immediately detecting seizures through electroencephalogram (EEG) wave monitoring and instant real-time alerts, patients, physicians, and other medical personnel, family, and friends can be informed of patient seizures before or as they start so that appropriate precautions and care can be provided more quickly. For this project, the research team developed an algorithm for identifying and analyzing the electromagnetic waves detected by a portable EEG device before, during, and after the patient has a seizure.  Our group achieved a means of detecting EEG waves through a Muse 2 headband, for reading the EEG waves in the brain, and a Raspberry Pi 4, a small microcomputer that processes the data and provides it in a clean, organized output. Using Machine and Deep Learning algorithms, we can analyze live data provided by a patient and can detect instantly if he/she is undergoing a seizure. Once that happens, alerts can be sent to people who can help, such as doctors or close family members, so that corresponding action can be taken.
