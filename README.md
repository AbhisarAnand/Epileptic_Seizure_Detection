## Abstract
The purpose of our research project was to use machine and deep learning algorithms to analyze live data to develop an effective and practical method of instantly detecting an oncoming seizure in patients with chronic seizure disorders including petit and grand mal epilepsy. A seizure involves excessive nerve and neuron signaling that creates an overload of electro-biochemical activities in the brain resulting in involuntary, autonomic sensations, behaviors, and even physical movements ranging from momentary or complete cessation of breathing and consciousness to dramatic to uncontrolled intellectual and/or physical activity that endanger patients and those around them. Some epilepsy and seizure disorders can be effectively treated; others even cured; however, due to the damage each and every seizure can cause to the brain, preventative care must start as soon as possible. The cells send and receive wave signals by ionic and other biochemical means to and through nodes of the brain that control parts of the body. One method of detecting oncoming seizures involves monitoring and recording electro-biochemical waves with an electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG records provide important insight into the various processes and types of seizures. Utilizing a Muse 2 headband to read EEG waves and a small Raspberry Pi 4 microcomputer to process data and provide clean, organized output, this research team wrote machine and deep learning algorithms to create a portable EEG device that in five (5)  seconds identifies, records, analyzes, and reports electro-biochemical waves before, during, and after seizures so that physicians, family, and other caregivers can be promptly alerted and provide immediate care. The device can easily be adapted to any wireless or cable telehealth monitoring and reporting device.
